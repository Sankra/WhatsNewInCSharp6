# What's new in C# 6
My take on what's new in C# 6. New features rankings of usefulness :

1. Getter-only auto-properties
2. Null-conditional operator
3. Expression-bodied members
4. Await in catch and finally blocks
5. nameof expressions
6. String interpolation
7. Using static
8. Exception filters
9. Initializers for auto-properties
10. Improved Initializers

## Example usage of demo console app
